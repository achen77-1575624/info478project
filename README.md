## What is the purpose of your research project?
The purpose of this research project is to determine if telehealth has increased therapy/counseling accessibility.


## What other research has been done in this area? Make sure to include 3+ links to related works, as well as a summary of what that work has discovered.
1. https://www.apa.org/monitor/2020/07/cover-telepsychology  
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals are under the stay-at-home order and may struggle with barriers in attaining mental health assistance, such as finances or transportation. Studies have shown that telehealth (or telepsychology) can be as effective as in person delivery of mental health services, and increases access to care. There are some challenges in telehealth, including not being able to completely read social cues from the patient during a phone or video call. Thus, further research is needed to determine the efficacy of telehealth in mental health services.

## What is the dataset you'll be working with?  Please include background on who collected the data, where you accessed it, and any additional information we should know about how this data came to be. You must find at least two data sources at this stage.

## Who is your target audience?  Depending on the domain of your data, there may be a variety of audiences interested in using the dataset. You should hone in on one of these audiences.
General adult population  
Caregivers  
Healthcare providers  
Therapists/teletherapy providers  

Our target audience will mainly be...

## What should your audience learn from your resource? Please consider specific questions that your project can answer using the data you have identified (that are related to the overarching purpose)
They can learn if telehealth has caused a reduction on suicide rates due to increased accessibility to mental healthcare providers, even with the COVID-19 pandemic.


# Technical Description
## What will be the format of your final product (Shiny app, HTML page, compiled .Rmd file, etc)?
The final product will be a Shiny app website.

## Do you anticipate any specific data collection / data management challenges?
We anticipate some challenges with finding relevant datasets that have columns we can join. If we code something wrong as well, it could potentially cause a ladder-effect where other part of the data will also be wrong.

## What new technical skills will need to learn in order to complete your project?
We will need to employ dplyr techniques to join and filter datasets. Additionally, we will need to use ggplot to create diagrams to map out our potential correlations.

## What major challenges do you anticipate? 
We'll need to brush up on some R techniques, including packages like dplyr.
